0x1B. C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

This project contains programs that explore Sorting algorithms andthe concept of Big O notation
in C programming. Sorting is an important concept in computer science because it helps in the 
arrangement of items and data in a specific way hence optimizing the performance of computer
programs. Big O notation is a type of mathematical notation that is used to express the maximum 
time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input.
This repository includes a variety of sorting algorithms that have been written in C along with 
analyses of Big O notation and their efficacy.
